# Project Inspired by Pyxiscience

This project is a partial reproduction of the Pyxiscience platform interface, with some graphical and functional liberties. It was developed as a personal project to familiarize myself with their tech stack and UX approach.

> [!WARNING]  
> **_Due to the very short development timeframe,
> only a few very bascis features are implemented,
> and the GraphQL API is just a learning POC._**

## Goals

- Reproduce a section of the platform with consistent UX
- Explore possible interactions (navigation, cards, etc.)
- Use the same technologies

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js (React)**
- **NestJS**
- **Prisma**
- **GraphQL**
- **Turborepo**

## Included Features

- Module interface with dynamic cards
- Sidebar with active navigation links
- Reusable components for forms, layout, etc.
- Dynamic routing system (Next.js)
- Basic GraphQL API

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The project was built without access to the original source code.
> - Design choices are based on publicly available elements
>   (screenshots from [Pyxiscienceâ€™s website](https://pyxiscience.com/)).
> - Goal: demonstrate some technical skills and adaptability to a new stack.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommanded)
